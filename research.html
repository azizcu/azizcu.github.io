                                In information retrieval (IR), query performance prediction (QPP) aims at predicting the effectiveness of a system for a given query without resorting to relevance judgments. QPP is useful to inform an IR system whether a given query is easy or incompetent, allowing the system to process it differently. For example, concerning an ineffective query, the system could either apply a specific automatic query reformulation or engage in an interactive session with the user (i.e., conversational IR) to understand the query and provide a better answer. Therefore, having accurate QPP predictors is a challenging topic. Query performance prediction usually uses query features that are extracted before running the query through the system (pre-retrieval) or from the initially retrieved documents (post-retrieval). In this project, the objectives are to develop QPP features and learn a machine-learning model that combines pre- and post-retrieval features to predict the effectiveness of a query. We have introduced summarized LETOR features as query features and combined them using a machine learning (ML) model to predict the QPP. We have also developed several effective Post-retrieval QPP predictors. The experiments on standard TREC benchmarks show that our proposed method outperforms the known related QPP methods. We are currently focusing on selecting QPP features and learning an ML model for enhancing the query performance prediction. In future, we will experiment and evaluate the QPP on Question answering collections.

                                <!-- <p>Modern information retrieval (IR) systems have become more and more complex, involving a large number of components and hyper-parameters. For example, a system may choose from a set of possible retrieval models (e.g., BM25, LM, etc.) or various query expansion parameters, whose values greatly inﬂuence the overall retrieval effectiveness. Traditionally, these parameters are set globally at a system level based on training queries at once. However, a global configuration of the system may not treat all future queries, which may have diverse characteristics. In this project, the objective is to treat individual queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. To deal with per-query, we have proposed to employ an adaptive IR approach by predicting the best system configuration. We cast this problem as a ranking of different possible system configurations and applied a learning-to-rank technique. The experiments on standard ad hoc TREC benchmarks show that this approach can significantly outperform the traditional method to tune the system and known related methods. In a further study, we improve our adaptive IR approach by selecting a pool of configurations using Risk-sensitive criteria</p> -->

When handling a new collection, finding the most appropriate system component for tuning as the most priority is a challenge since many factors influence the system effectiveness, such as the system components, internal parameters, and document collection. In this project, the objective is to analyze which modules and parameters influence system effectiveness the most. We have performed this statistical analysis at various levels based on several data analysis methods; each method is appropriate to reveal different aspects of the problem. We use an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to explore the components that statistically significantly influence the effectiveness, classification and regression tree (CART) to model the impact of the different component modalities and data visualization. We are currently focusing on analyzing these IR components on a large scale for various collections.</p> -->

                                <!-- <p>Social media eases information spreading, makes information diffusion quicker, and reaches potentially more people than traditional media, in many cases regardless of the information quality. Automatic fact-checking could be a solution to warn social media users and readers or even to stop the spreading of fake news. In this project, the objective is to identify and verify the check-worthy claims. In our approach, we represent the claims using features based on Information nutritional-based labels, word embedding, and linguistics. To predict the check-worthy claims, we learn a machine-learning model. The experimental results on standard benchmark datasets show that our approach improves the performance compared to the related methods. We are currently focusing on integrating context-aware features and performing a feature selection considering a deeper analysis.</p> -->

                                <!-- <p>Germinal center (GC) and non-germinal center (NGC) are two different types of lymphomas (cancer), and classification of these types are important in cancer diagnosis. Several algorithms were developed based on gene expression and some biological assumptions that are too costly to obtain. In this project, the objective is to classify GC vs NGC types from a whole-slide histopathology image. In this regard, we propose to classify the whole-slide image (WSI) by leveraging the region of interest (ROI) based on whole-slide annotated images. First, we consider the image patch from the bounding box of the annotated slide at a specific resolution level. Then, we transform the extracted annotated image patch from the annotation slide to the original slide at a higher resolution level and extract the regular patches from the original whole-slide image. For GC vs NGC classification, we consider multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN), including GoogleNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet, to be enabled diverse learning from the patches. We also ensemble the prediction probabilities of multiple deep models to estimate an accurate prediction. We evaluate our approach using a recent WSI dataset from Oncopole Toulouse. Currently, we are focusing on combining the prediction of classifiers learned from higher and lower resolution levels of images.</p> -->

The search engine responds to a ranked list of documents/answers to fulfil the information need. Web search queries are usually vague, ambiguous, or tend to have multiple intents. Users may have different search intents while issuing the same search query (e.g., the word –address– may mean the place someone lives or a formal speech delivered to an audience). If the issued search query conveys a variety of interpretations, the ad hoc search result may be far from “what the user wants to have.” In this project, our objectives are to understand the search query and present the ranked list of documents/answers accordingly. We have performed the query understanding by extracting the subtopics covering the dynamic search intents underlying the search query. We have also developed a method for ranking the subtopics of the search query by exploiting the locally trained word-embedding based features, a bipartite graph-based ranking, and estimating the novelty of subtopics by combining contextual and categorical similarities. We have experimented and evaluated our proposed methods on two benchmark datasets and a large-scale Web corpus; the result shows better performance than known related works.</p> -->

Users often turn to social network platforms for sharing their personal views, experiences, and important news while also getting some information. Among several social network sites, Twitter is now the most popular, where users post short-text tweets or engage in interaction with a reply/mention whenever a notable event occurs. That is why Information retrieval in the Twitter-sphere has made a hit with many complacencies. In this project, our objective is to retrieve and re-rank the tweets with the temporal dimension for a search query. Vocabulary mismatch and temporal burst are two challenging issues of short-text in microblog retrieval. To re-rank the short-text tweets, we have proposed efficient and effective learning to rank approach while addressing vocabulary mismatch and temporal burst issues based on content and context-aware features. We have experimented, evaluated our proposed approach on two benchmark datasets, and shown better performance than the known related methods.</p> -->

Such collections of images could be leveraged in various potential applications such as recommending restaurant menus, tourist guides and entertainment facilities, traffic congestions, local weather information, crime investigation, and so on. There should have semantic links or annotations among these images to develop such an application. However, there is no such annotation for most of the image data on the Internet. Some description of the image is available on the Web page where the image appears; however, the relationship between the surrounding text and images is redundant and irrelevant, varies greatly. Despite the vast applicability of such multi-modal information in machine learning, it makes weak supervision, which is a challenging problem. In this project, our objective is to annotate images with semantically relevant keywords or concepts. We have proposed a new method based on ontology, graph structure immerged from multi-modal information, and machine learning to annotate images. First, we have developed an ontology-based approach to harvest training examples from the noisy-labelled images collected from the Web. Second, we have introduced a graph structure to model the context around the image and define a new kernel function to propagate ontology-based text and image features across multi-domain concepts. Third, we have an ensemble of voting strategies and probability estimates from multiple binary classifiers for tackling multi-class multi-label problems. We have experimented with, evaluated the proposed method using two benchmark datasets (the ImageCLEF 2013 and 2014), and shown that our approach outperforms the known related methods.</p> -->
